# A.I
This is my first project on A.I using python
Made by Vaibhav
In this project I make certain modules to make it work perfectly like I use :->
speech_recognition module inorder to recognizing the voice, pyttsx3 module(pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python), smtplib module (The smtplib module defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon)
